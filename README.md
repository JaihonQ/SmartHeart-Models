 🫀 # SmartHeart – Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
SmartHeart is a machine learning project designed to predict the presence of heart disease using clinical and demographic patient data.
This project is implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook and evaluates multiple supervised learning algorithms to compare their performance.
The goal of this project is to assist in early detection of heart disease by leveraging data-driven models and statistical analysis.
